# IgetaIM
An instant messaging application involving a server and multiple clients (in progress).

Instructions:
Run IgetaServer.java before running IgetaClient.java. The application is currently configured to run on the same computer (127.0.0.1). To use on different computers, modify the IP address in IgetaClient.java to your own server's IP address. Running IgetaClient.java will prompt the user for a username. 

I have coded most of the essential functionalities of the program, but I am still making nice-to-have improvements to the application.
